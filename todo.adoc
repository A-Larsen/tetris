- [ ] Add rotation
        With the way everything is currently set up rotation would be difficult.
        I make the dementions of the tetrinomios arrays a cube (equal width and
        height). Rotation would be much simpler.

- [ ] Fix how last piece gets drawn before you loose

- [ ] need to make sure you cannot rotate out of bounds, or into other pieces

- [ ] make sure you can't rotate a placed piece!
